<center><h3>Self-discipline and problem solving</h3></center>
</div>
<p>“Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with
what happens to him.”
<b>(ALDOUS HUXLEY)</b><br> 
Thoughts are causes and conditions are effects. Therefore, the quality of
your thinking largely determines the quality of your life. The greatest
mental principle is that “you become what you think about most of the
time.”
Top people in every field are intensively solution-oriented . They think
about solutions most of the time. Instead of getting bogged down in who
did or didn't do something or other, the most successful people in every
field concentrate on the solutions and what can be done to solve the
problem.
The Sufi philosopher Izrhat Khan once said, “Life is a continuous
succession of problems, like waves from the ocean. They never stop.” This
means that your ability to practice self-discipline, self-mastery, and self-control when faced with the never-ending flow of problems, difficulties,
setbacks, and temporary failures you will experience is essential to your
success in business and in life.</p>
<div class="pr">
<h3>The Inevitable and Unavoidable Crisis</h3>
</div>
<p>Throughout your life, you will face a river of problems—physical,
financial, family, business, and political. The only break in this never-ending chain of problems will be the occasional crisis. If you are living a
normal life, you will probably experience a crisis every two or three
months. And it is in these crises that you truly demonstrate the quality of
your personality and the strength of your character.
It is only when you face unexpected reversals and setbacks that you show
the world what you are truly made of. All of life is a “test.” The only
question for you is do you pass or fail?
By their very nature, crises come “unbidden.” You have no warning or
ability to anticipate them in advance. If you did, it wouldn’t be a crisis in
the first place—obviously, or you would already be prepared. When the
inevitable crisis occurs, more than at any other time, self-discipline is
required so you can remain calm and clear-headed in order to deal with the
crisis effectively.</p>
<div class="pr">
<h3>Perform at Your Best</h3>
</div>
<p>When something goes wrong, the natural tendency of most people is to
become angry and look around for someone to blame. But this is a waste of
energy. It solves nothing. Instead, you must discipline yourself to remain
calm, objective, and unemotional.
When you face an unexpected problem or crisis, discipline yourself to
stay calm, to focus on the solution rather than the problem. Think in terms
of what can be done now, rather than thinking about how it occurred and
who is to blame.
Like an accident where someone is hurt, you focus on caring for the
injured person, stopping the bleeding, and minimizing the damage before
you start analyzing what and how it happened. Practice self-discipline when
dealing with a problem or crisis by immediately saying, “I am responsible,”
even if, at that moment, you are responsible only for controlling your
responses.</p>
<div class="pr">
<h3>Keep Your Mind Clear</h3>
</div>
<p>Top people have developed the ability to respond effectively to a crisis, to
remain calm, relaxed, and clear-eyed. They discipline themselves to stay
cool and unemotional. This enables them to think more clearly, to analyze
the situation objectively, and to make better decisions.
But the moment you become angry and upset, your neocortex—or your
“thinking brain”—shuts down. All you have left then is your paleocortex,
your emotional brain, which thinks in terms of “fight or flight.” When your
emotional brain is in charge, you think in terms of black and white, yes or
no, or doing something or doing nothing. You lose the ability to think in
shades of gray and to look at all the different possible ways to deal with this
particular situation.
Top people realize that every problem is an opportunity to grow in self-control and personal confidence. In fact, you will rise in life to the height of
the problems that you are capable of solving.</p>
<div class="pr">
<h3>Stepping Stones to Success</h3>
</div>
<p>Some years ago, Dr. Lawrence Peter wrote a book called The Peter
Principle. It was an amusing book with a central thesis that cut too close to
home. He wrote that in every organization, people continue to be promoted
until they reach a level where they are no longer competent to solve the
problems at that level. This is where they stop and stay for the rest of their
careers.
Furthermore, he pointed out that for this reason, every organization is
eventually staffed by people who have reached their level of incompetence.
This is especially true in government, and it is the primary reason why
government is so time- and cost-inefficient, making it difficult to get
anything done at all. This is usually true in any large bureaucracy.
In your own personal life, you continue to rise in your company and your
profession in direct proportion to your ability to solve the problems and
make the necessary decisions at each level of your career. The good news is
that when you think about solutions most of the time, you train your brain
to be intensively solution oriented.
No matter what problems or difficulties arise around you, your brain will
be continually seeking creative ways to solve the problem. As a result, you
actually become smarter and quicker, with more of your thinking brain
available to you faster.
If you want to learn a physical sport, you begin by learning the basic
moves and then the more advanced moves. You practice these skills over
and over again until you can perform them and go through the motions
naturally and easily every time.
To master the discipline of problem solving, you need to develop a
formula or method that enables you to deal effectively with almost any
problem you face in the course of your career or personal life. Fortunately,
there is a proven formula for problem solving and decision making that you
can use in almost any situation. Let's take a look.</p>
<div class="pf">
<h3>A Nine-Step Method for Solving Problems Effectively</h3>
</div>
<p><b>Step 1: Take the Time to Define the Problem Clearly.</b> In medicine, they say
that “accurate diagnosis is half the cure.” Therefore, you need to ask, “What
exactly is the problem?” It is absolutely amazing how several people can
become upset about a problem in an organization, but every one of them has
a different idea or definition of the exact nature of the problem they're
facing. Your job is to achieve clarity and to get everyone to agree on the
definition of the problem before you move on to the business of solving it.<br><br>
<b>Step 2: Ask, “Is It Really a Problem?”</b> Remember, there are some things
that you can do nothing about. They're not problems; they are merely facts
of life. If interest rates rise or the subprime mortgage market collapses, this
is not a problem. It is not something that is amenable to a solution. Instead,
it is something that must be worked around and dealt with.
Also, very often what appears to be a problem or a setback is actually an
opportunity in disguise. Sometimes, the problem does not need to be solved
at all. Instead, you are now free to do something completely different—
which might be even better for you and your organization.<br><br>
<b>Step 3: Ask, “What Else Is the Problem?”</b> Beware of any problem for
which there is only one definition. The more ways you can define a
problem, the more likely it is that you will find the best solution.
When we work with corporations in which sales are below a desired
level, we force them to ask twenty-one questions, all of which are
different ways of restating the problem. Each restatement of the
problem, if accepted as the correct definition, leads to a different
solution and often to a completely different direction for the
organization.
For example, we will ask, “What is the problem?” and the first
answer is “Our sales are too low.”
The next question is “What else is the problem?”
Answer: “Our competitor's sales are too high.”
Notice the difference. If the problem is that your sales are too low,
the solution may be to increase your advertising and promotion and
beef up your sales activities. If the definition is that your competitor's
sales are too high, the answer may be to improve your products,
change your product line, lower your prices, or go into a completely
different business altogether.
By asking and answering a series of questions like this, we
eventually find the correct definition, one that is amenable to a
workable solution.<br><br>
<b>Step 4: Ask, “How Did This Problem Occur?”</b> Seek to understand the
causes of the problem so you can ensure that it doesn't happen again. In
your life or business, if a problem recurs repeatedly, it is a sign that your
business is poorly organized or out of control in that area. There is a defect
built into your systems that is causing the same problem to recur. Your job
is to find out why this happens repeatedly so you can solve the problem at
its root.<br><br>
<b>Step 5: Ask, “What Are All the Possible Solutions?”</b> The more possible
solutions you develop, the more likely you will come up with the right one.
The quality of the solution seems to be in direct proportion to the quantity
of solutions considered in problem solving. Beware a problem for which
there is only one solution.<br><br>
<b>Step 6: Ask, “What Is the Best Solution at This Time?”</b> Sometimes, any
solution is better than no solution. An average solution vigorously executed
is often superior to an excellent solution that cannot be implemented
because of its complexity or because no one has the ability to execute it.
The rule is that fully 80 percent of all problems should be dealt with
immediately. Only 20 percent of problems need to be put off to a later time.
If you must put off a problem, set a specific deadline for making a decision
on that problem, and then make your decision at that deadline with
whatever information you have at that time.
There is a rule that says that every large problem was once a small
problem that could have been solved easily and inexpensively at that time.
Sometimes, the best strategy is to “nip it in the bud.” When it is clear that
there is a problem and a solution, do what has to be done—and do it
quickly.<br><br>
<b>Step 7: Make a Decision.</b> Select a solution, any solution, and then decide
on a course of action. Always ask, “What is our next action? What are we
going to do now?”<br><br>
<b>Step 8: Assign Responsibility.</b> Who exactly is going to carry out the
solution or the different elements of the solution? It is quite common for a
group to meet to solve a problem and to agree on a solution, but when the
group meets again two weeks later, it turns out that nothing has happened.
Why? No one was made specifically responsible for carrying out the
decision.<br><br>
<b>Step 9: Set a Measure for the Decision.</b> What are you trying to accomplish
with this decision, and how will you measure results? How will you know
that it worked? The more accurately you can determine the result that you
want to achieve by the solution, the more likely it is that you will achieve it.</p>
<div class="pf">
<h3>The Big Reward</h3>
</div>
<p>The main reward you get for solving problems is the opportunity to solve
bigger and more important problems. Your rate of pay and speed of
promotion and therefore your forward movement in your career are largely
determined by your problem-solving ability. The more you focus on
solutions, the more solutions you will come up with, and the more valuable
your contribution will be to your organization.
The flip side of self-esteem is called “self-efficacy.” Your level of self-efficacy is defined as “how competent you feel you are to solve your
problems and achieve your goals.”
The more competent you feel you are to solve the problems and
difficulties of daily life, the more you like yourself. The more you like
yourself, the more confident and competent you become in solving even
larger problems and getting even more important results.</p>
<div class="pf">
<h3>The Determinant of Your Success</h3>
</div>
<p>In your work, your problem-solving ability largely determines everything
you accomplish. People who are good at solving problems are some of the
most valuable and respected people in every area. For this reason, success
has been defined as “the ability to solve problems.” This also means that
happiness is the ability to solve problems. Leadership is the ability to solve
problems.
When you practice self-discipline and self-control in face of the
inevitable and unavoidable problems and crises of day-to-day life, you
become more competent and effective in everything you do. You will be
respected and esteemed by everyone around you. You will experience a
tremendous feeling of personal power and competence. In no time at all,
you will become one of the most valuable people in your organization.</p>
<div class="pf">
<h3>Action Exercises:</h3>
</div>
<p>1. Solving problems is like solving mathematical equations:
It is learnable with practice and repetition. Start by determining
the biggest problems facing you today.
2. Accept complete responsibility for solving the problems
you encounter in your daily work, and then think about the
solutions.
3. Define your biggest business or personal problem clearly.
Write it down. What exactly is the problem?
4. Why is this a problem? Could it be an opportunity in
disguise? If so, what opportunity or lesson could this problem
contain?
5. What else is the problem? Perhaps the real problem is
something else, something you might not want to face?
6. What are all the possible solutions? What else could be a
solution?
7. Select the best solution that is available to you right now, and take action immediately.</p>
